## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will talk about time series forecasting. As mentioned on the title, I will use [R](https://www.rstudio.com/) (or Posit from October 2022).
Time series forecasting is a prediction technic for data involving time component. The idea is to use historical data to predict the future.
I will use the data of Store Sales-Time Series Forecasting in Kaggle competition. It is about sales in Ecuador between 2013 and 2017. You can download data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview) or directly from [my github](https://github.com/JamBelg/Time-Series-Forcasting-with-R).
